# MediumRSS-collection-search

The Jewish Museum [online collection](http://thejewishmuseum.org/collection/) has a "related blog" field for collection objects.  
The Jewish Museum uses [Medium](https://medium.com/@TheJewishMuseum) as its blogging platform.  

I use this script to provide a weekly summary of all hyperlinks to collection objects in Medium posts. 

This script requires the following libraries:
